## Basket Optimiser 🛒
**A smart price comparison dashboard for everyday essentials.
Automatically scrapes product prices from Amazon, Target, and Walmart, normalizes units (e.g., oz, count), and calculates per-unit cost.
Visualizes weekly price trends and helps users build optimized shopping lists across platforms.**

This project, **Basket Optimiser**, addresses this transparency issue by building an automated Data Science and Engineering solution to standardize and visualize grocery prices.

The goal of project is to create a reliable, reproducible system that:

- **Standardizes Pricing:** Converts all disparate units of measure (weight, volume, count) into a single, comparable metric (e.g., price per 100g, price per sheet).
- **Automates Data Collection:** Utilizes scheduled web scraping pipelines to collect up-to-date pricing data from major U.S. retailers (Target, Walmart, Amazon).
- **Provides Actionable Insights:** Presents the unit-standardized prices and historical trends on a clean, accessible dashboard, empowering consumers to make the most informed purchasing decisions and combat inflation effectively.


### Background
The modern consumer faces a significant challenge when attempting to make cost-effective purchasing decisions for common household goods. Due to the proliferation of e-commerce platforms like Amazon, Target, and Walmart, the sheer volume of choices is overwhelming.

The core problem, known as price opacity, stems from the lack of standardization in product units:

1. **Inconsistent Units:** A common product, such as paper towels or chicken breast, may be priced per unit (e.g., "12 rolls"), by weight (e.g., "32 oz"), or by count (e.g., "100 sheets") across different retailers and brands.

2. **Difficult Comparison:** Manually calculating the true unit price (e.g., price per sheet, price per ounce) across multiple websites is tedious, time-consuming, and prone to human error.

This lack of standardization creates an information asymmetry, preventing shoppers from efficiently identifying the most cost-effective option and hindering optimal spending habits.

### Implementation:
     .venv/bin/streamlit run app.py

### Status Update
✅ Fixed

Resolved pricing sort issue where items with $0 unit price were incorrectly ranked at the top.

Improved unit price normalization logic to prevent invalid or incomplete price data from affecting ranking.

🚀 Enhancement

Expanded advanced unit parsing & pricing engine to support more complex formats, including:

12 x 1000 sheets

24 x 2 oz

40 pack of 16.9 oz

Improved multi-pack and compound quantity detection for more accurate unit price calculation.

Strengthened fallback handling for irregular product descriptions.

🔜 Next Steps

Redesign and simplify the dashboard UI to improve clarity and usability.

Make ranking insights more visually intuitive.

Reduce cognitive load and highlight the “Best Deal” more effectively.
